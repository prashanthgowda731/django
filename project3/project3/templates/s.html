		<h1>HISTORY</h1>
	<div> 
			<p allign="justify">Hassan district was the seat of the Hoysala Empire which at its peak ruled large parts of south India from <a href="s1.html" target="blank">Belur</a> as its early capital and <a href="s2.html" target="blank">Halebidu</a> as its later capital during the period 1000 - 1334 CE.<br>
				The district is named Hassan after the Goddess "Haasanamba", the goddess and presiding deity of the town. The history of Hassan district is essentially the history of two of the well known dynasties that have ruled Karnataka, the Western Ganga Dynasty of Talkad (350 - 999 CE) and the Hoysala Empire (1000 - 1334 CE). In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Vijayanagar kings patronised Chennakesava of Belur as their family deity. It was also ruled by Adilshahis of Bijapur and Mughal Empire after decline of the Vijayanagar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the Keladi Nayakas of Shimoga and the Mysore Kingdom. It finally merged as an independent Mysore kingdom.</p>
